    "Is ice a solid or a fluid? \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, solids and fluids are often not mutually exclusive categories. The distinction, instead, is a matter of timescale. If you take an ice cube out of your freezer and hit it with a hammer, it shatters like glass, exhibiting the trademark brittle behaviour of elastic solids. However, if you applied the same force gradually, that ice cube would slowly deform as if it were made of molasses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Glaciers behave the same way. Although intense forces can result in sudden, solid-like behaviour - like crevassing and iceberg calving - over long timespans, glaciers behave like thick, viscous fluids oozing outward under the force of their own weight. The laws that govern glacier dynamics, therefore, are the same laws that govern fluid dynamics. These are called the Navier-Stokes Equations, and they are notoriously hard to solve. In fact, there is a standing million-dollar prize for anyone who can prove the existence of a general solution to these equations. Modeling a single glacier with the full Navier-Stokes Equations can take weeks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, glaciologists often consider approximations to these equations, where terms deemed \"unimportant\" in certain environments are left out. This vastly simplifies the mathematics - and the computational cost. There are several common approximations used by glaciologists in different physical settings. Here we'll construct at one of the simplest: the Shallow Ice Approximation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Our goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goals of this notebook are to set up a simple glacier and evaluate the ice velocity within that domain, and to determine the resulting change in glacier shape over time. To do so, we'll go through several steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "> (i) Set up the glacier domain\n",
    "> \n",
    "> (ii) Obtain the *stress field* from the governing equation\n",
    "> \n",
    "> (iii) Use a *constitutive relation* to relate stresses to velocity gradients\n",
    "> \n",
    "> (iv) Solve for the horizontal velocity\n",
    "> \n",
    "> (v) Invoke *mass conservation* to relate horizontal velocities to vertical velocity gradients\n",
    "> \n",
    "> (vi) Solve for the vertical velocity\n",
    "> \n",
    "> (vii) Estimate the glacier's shape change over time, due to both the dynamics discussed above, as well as climate forcing. \n",
    "\n",
    "### (i) Glacier geometry\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the mathematics as simple as possible, we'll construct a glacier flowline model. This means we ignore any flow-resisting forces originating from the sides, and we consider only the long, thin slice along the centerline. This lets us simplify to two dimensions, with $x$ the along-flow direction, and $z$ the vertical direction. Begin by constructing a 2D grid in $x$ and $z$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, first use [numpy.linspace](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html) to construct an array called```x``` and one called ```z```. ```x``` represents the $x$-axis; let it span from $0$ to $100e3$ metres. ```z``` represents the $z$-axis; let it span from $0$ to $2e3$ metres. Let both axes consist of $1000$ cells. Then, use [numpy.meshgrid](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/generated/numpy.meshgrid.html) to construct a 2D mesh from these axis arrays, with capital ```X``` and capital ```Z``` the gridded values of ```x``` and ```z```.

In glacier settings dominated by $\\tau_x$, the bedrock provides little resistance to motion, and the glacier is free to speed up significantly along-flow, with the front moving considerably faster than ice upstream. $\\tau_z$, conversely, describes shear forces acting on the ice, which are most significant when a glacier's base is stuck to the bedrock. In glacier settings dominated by $\\tau_z$, the glacier terminus may still flow faster than ice upstream, but the most pronounced velocity differences are vertical: most motion occurs near the top surface, while the bedrock resists flow at depth. **This latter situation is the one considered by the Shallow Ice Approximation.** \n",

Toward the terminus, at lower elevation, melting may outweigh snowfall, and the surface lowers: this is the ablation zone, where the surface mass balance in negative.

To obtain a reasonable lapse rate, try setting ```lapse_rate = numpy.nanmax(w)/numpy.nanmean(s)``` (this is just to ensure that the accumulation/melt rates are comparable to the rates of dynamic thickening/thinning from vertical flow). Finally, define ```a_dot``` as an array with the surface mass balance values corresponding to these parameter choices.
